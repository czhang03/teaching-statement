Attended a liberal arts colleges during my undergrad, I feel that the teaching of my mentors has not only imparted me with knowledge, but also shaped me into the person I am now.
Till this day, I still maintain a lasting relationship with professors of my college, and frequently find wisdom in their perpetual guidance.
Like them, my teaching is aspired to present lasting effects on the students, seeking to engage, inspire, and present principled and transferable knowledge that will benefit the students no matter their life paths.

Indeed, with rapid and universal availability of information, I believe teaching will need to emphasize core ideas and transferable skills.
While many have been discouraged by the emergence of large language model, I see them as an opportunity to devise engaging and inspiring plan to allow students to see the value and joy in learning, and potentially collaborate with new technologies to achieve their learning goals.
Like most people have talked to, I don't have a conclusive answer the current challenges in teaching, but from both experience as a student and as a teacher, I find there are following points that can help with this goal:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core idea and abstraction:} simplicity is engaging, and generality is transferable. 
  Both concepts points towards abstraction. 
  The end goal of each class is for student to understand a few simple and abstract concepts that can be used to practice and derive most of the topics in a course. 
  Years after, students might not be able to remember most of the examples in the class, but they should be able to remember couple core concepts, and can recreate examples in suitable situations.
  \item \textbf{Grounded:} Abstraction without context is a floating garden. Despite all of its elegance, there will be no way to reach or exit it.
  Thus, it is important to not only guide the student to the abstract concepts via examples, but also allow student to practice these concepts and come up with their own examples.
  In class, I will start with concrete use cases or surprising connections to motivate the abstract concepts. 
  After class, in homework, labs, and exams, the students will practice applying these concepts on their own.
  \item \textbf{Engagement:} I see cheating student as a lost opportunity to educate.
  In my experiences, many students start to cheat when they feel discouraged by the material or anxious about their grade. 
  This group of students is the focus of my engagement effort. 
  Besides engaging with realistic and interesting examples, I also make sure that grading metrics provides guidance for students to improve the learning outcome, but not punishments.
  This effort is extensively studied in game design, and my approach indeed draws inspirations from other fields: give opportunities for students to quickly recover from their mistake and provide students an alternative path forward.
  Specifically, I prefer a lax yet effective attendance system, extensive office hour, and online presence through piazza, resubmission for partial (or full) credit, quick and actionable feedback, include extra credit problems in most assignments, and many methods to encourage study groups. 
  \item \textbf{Exploration:} Besides homework, exam, and extra credit problems, I want to also provide plenty of opportunities to mentor student to further explore their interest. 
  These include study/reading group, research seminars, and undergrad research opportunities.
  I have extensive experience organizing study/reading group during my time at BU, we have long-running MathComp (Coq) and category theory reading groups, both organized by me. 
  I have also organized BU POPV seminar for years, attracting many researchers and students from BU and beyond to communicate novel research ideas and opportunities.
  Similarly, I also have experience mentoring undergrad researches.
\end{itemize}

Practically, I have TA'ed a vast number of classes across different fields at Boston University, including introductory python class (CS 111, CS112), basic number theory and abstract algebra (CS 235 Algebraic Algorithm), linear algebra (CS 132: Geometric Algorithm), and programming languages (CS320).
During this process, I have obtained extensive experience organizing graders, working with students, and designing classes.

I want to present my philosophy through the designing of our Haskell course (2019 Spring, Principle of Programming Language). 
I will illustrate my thought process when co-designing this class, and a number of improvements I seek to adopt in my future teaching.
